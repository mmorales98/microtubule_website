  Statistical Analysis of Microtuble Catastrophe Experimental Data
authors: >
  Maryann Morales, Eva Kercmar
Abstract: >
  As part of of the BeBi103a course at Caltech, we have designed a website 
  that displays our statistical analysis of a portion of the data from the paper by 
  Gardner et al., 2011  (information below).
Summary:  >
  Microtubules are dynamic filamens that contain ends which alternate between slow growth
  and rapid shortening as traverse intracellular space and move organelles. Microtubules turnover
  through a process of dynamic instability. In this process, there is assembly at the plus end of
  the microtubule as well as alternating disassembly at the minus end. This sudden transition is 
  referred to as catastrophe. The mechanism of catastrophe is poorly understood. In Gardner et al., 2011, 
  the authors seek to undedrstand this catastrophe mechanism by depolymerzing kinesins which are 
  catastrophe factors. 
  
  As our project, we analyzed the data of the catastrophe dependence on microtubule age over a range of 
  tubulin concentrations. Tubulin is the protein sub unit that is assembled and dissassembled.In the 
  experiment the tubulin is labeled and allows for tracking.
